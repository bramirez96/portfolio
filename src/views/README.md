# Views

The views folder should contain all of the static HTML pages as well as the javascript (typescript) that is needed to enable them to work properly. Not the for each page created, new entries will have to be added to the `entry` property in the webpack configuration, and you will also have to add a new instance of the HTMLWebpackPlugin.

The file structure of this folder should reflect the routing structure of the multi-page application.
